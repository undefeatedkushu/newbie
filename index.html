            <h1>The Artist & The Art</h1>
            <h3>We see ourselves growing closer and getting<br>
              attached to the artist. For many, the art becomes<br>
              the artist themselves. Aet si an abstract concept,<br>
              but the artist, nevertheless, is a human. It's far<br>
              easier to love a human and identify with them<br>
              rather than a concept or a piece of work.</h3><br>
